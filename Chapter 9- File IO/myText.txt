As long as you continue to say the words "one day", the dream is not over.
Maybe it will simply reamin a beautiful dream.
It may never come true.
But that is one way to live.
The days go by more happily when you have something to dream about.
It's not always a bad thing to have a dream, with no plan of ever carrying it out.
